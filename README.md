# Goal

Develop a module to deal with (and thereby streamline) everyday RD (2012 and above) Session management tasks.

## Tasks

- [x] Copy progress so far in to Repo
- [x] Create develop branch for work
- [x] Split the various manually-executed sections of the script in to useable functions within a module
- [ ] Develop further functions which would prove useful
- [ ] Test (in 2012, 2012 R2 and 2016 environments)
- [ ] Add comment-based help
- [ ] Publish...?

## Tangents

- [ ] Make it possible to pipe results of Get-x functions into Do-x functions
- [ ] See if it's possible to work with a table and select one or more individual sessions to Do-x functions
